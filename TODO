all utils:
  import_constants

all filters:
 change how filters work, they should not know about URIs, they should take a (read) initialized driver 
 and act as a filter over that driver - they don't have exactly the same interface as normal drivers

atsort
  Preserve header as 1st line, read from and write to any 2 urls
  shell out to gnu sort to keep it simple
    atsort some://url
    atsort -r some://url

implement a method_missing : respond_to? ("import_#{other_schema}") and "export_#{other_schema}"
  allow the databse drivers to use their import/export features when they recognize
  that it's a simple format and going to/from a file.
